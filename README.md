The !BiSciCol triplifier, which is part of the [http://biscicol.blogspot.com/ BiSciCol project], 
provides an easy way to convert structured biodiversity data into
[http://www.w3.org/RDF/ Resource Description Framework (RDF)] triples.  
RDF is one of the core technologies behind the Semantic Web (SW).

The Triplifier accepts data in a variety of common input formats and converts them into a full RDF 
representation using a consistent RDF vocabulary based mostly on [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm Darwin Core (DwC)] 
with RDFS classes and explicit relationships among the class instances.  
Because so much biodiversity data is expressed using the DwC data standard, and given the growing 
ubiquity of DwC-Archives (DwC-A's), The Triplifier can automatically produce RDF from DwC-A's.  
This automated process requires the user to have only minimal knowledge of SW technologies.   
The Triplifier is Free and Open Source software that can be used either as a graphical 
[http://www.biscicol.org/triplifier/ Web-based application] or as a local command-line tool.  
For more details about the development, scope, and context of the Triplifier project, you may want to 
consult the [http://biscicol.blogspot.com/ BiSciCol blog] to read about past and current efforts.

If you would like to learn more, we encourage you to try out the [http://www.biscicol.org/triplifier/ Triplifier] 
with your own data.  To get started, you'll want to check out the [Documentation documentation]. 
If you are a software developer or really curious about how the Triplifier works under the hood, you can also 
browse the [http://triplifier.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/web/doc/index.html javadoc for the triplifier source code].
