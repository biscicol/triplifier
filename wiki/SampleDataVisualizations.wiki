#summary Sample Visualizations of a single dataset

= Introduction to Visualizing Triplifier Data =

To illustrate what data looks like after triplifying, we have provided the following example dataset and accompanying visualizations based on the Henderson Field Notebook Dataset.  The abbreviated dataset is limited to 1 row so content can be visualized in graphical form, which would be impossible to understand visually with 1000 rows.   The user can explore the content below and find additional information on working with triplifier output data at [WhatCanIDoWithMyData here].
