#summary information on using the Command-line triplifier

= Command-Line Triplifier =

To run the triplifier from the command-line, you can download a pre-compiled executable from the downloads folder in the svn repo at https://code.google.com/p/triplifier/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdownloads

Once you download and install the package on your system (available on either Mac or Unix), you just type "triplify" on the command prompt and help will be displayed.  

Currently, all output files are written to the same directory as where the application lives.. i haven't been able to figure out how to reference this on the path and have output written out to a more sensible location.  

More options on the command-line triplifier are coming!
