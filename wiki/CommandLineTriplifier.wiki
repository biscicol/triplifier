#summary Information on using the Command-line triplifier

= Command-Line Triplifier =

To run the triplifier from the command-line, you can download a pre-compiled executable from the  [https://code.google.com/p/triplifier/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdownloads downloads folder] (part of the SVN repository).

Once you download and install the package on your system you just type "triplify" on the command prompt and the following help will be displayed:

{{{
usage: triplify input_files [-debug] [-f <arg>] [-h] [-hasGuids] [-m
       <arg>] [-roots <arg>] [-t <arg>] [-v]
 -debug                   Output debug statements and do not delete
                          processing files, enabling the user to debug
                          application
 -f,--format <arg>        Set the output format to one of:
                          ...N3
                          ...NTriple (default)
                          ...Turtle
                          ...DOT (Graphviz)
 -h,--help                print this help message and exit
 -hasGuids                Use this if you have persistent identifiers
                          already in place-- that is, they are resolvable,
                          persistent, and especially you must ensure they
                          are all properly formatted URIs.  If you do not
                          add this option, the default is to use a system
                          specific prefix.
 -m,--mappingFile <arg>   Provide a D2RQ mapping file
                          (http://d2rq.org/d2rq-language).  If this option
                          is set it will ignore all other steps, and
                          triplify only based on the mapping file.
 -roots <arg>             Provide a deepRoots file (see
                          http://code.google.com/p/bcid/wiki/deepRoots)
                          This option will use Deep Roots mapping for
                          generated GUIDs.
 -t,--type <arg>          Set the input data file type to one of:
                          ...genbank
                          ...dwc (Darwin Core Archive)
 -v,--version             Print the program version and exit.

==Examples==

Suppose we want to triplify a darwin core archive, we would use the following command:

{{{
./triplify myDarwinCoreArchive.zip -i dwc > ~/myoutputfile.txt
}}}

==Running from Source==
You may also choose to download the entire source tree, build using [http://ant.apache.org/ ant], and run using java itself from the commandline:
{{{
svn checkout http://triplifier.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ triplifier-read-only
cd triplifier-read-only/
ant
java -classpath .:./out/triplifier:./lib/* triplify -h
java -classpath .:./out/triplifier/:./lib/* triplify myDarwinCoreArchive.zip -o dwc
