#summary Information on using the Command-line triplifier

= Command-Line Triplifier =

To run the triplifier from the command-line, you can download a pre-compiled executable from the  [https://code.google.com/p/triplifier/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdownloads downloads folder] (part of the SVN repository).

Once you download and install the package on your system (available on either Mac or Unix), you just type "triplify" on the command prompt and the following help will be displayed:

usage: triplify input_files [-D <arg>] [-d] [-g] [-h] [-m <arg>] [-o
       <arg>] [-p] [-s] [-t <arg>]
 -D,--deepRoot <arg>          Provide a deepRoots File.  If this option is
                              set it will use Deep Roots mapping from this
                              file.  This is not common currently.
 -d,--dontFixDwCA             In cases where we are triplifying DwC
                              Archives, do not attempt to fix them using
                              the DwCFixer. This saves many cycles of
                              compute time but the results are not as
                              robust.
 -g,--graphviz                Output a graphviz DOT format file
 -h,--help                    print this help message and exit
 -m,--mappingFile <arg>       Provide a mapping file.  If this option is
                              set it will ignore all other steps,not
                              create a SQLlite database but just go
                              straight to triplification by reading the
                              mapping file.
 -o,--outputDirectory <arg>   Output all files to this directory. Default
                              is to the use a directory called
                              tripleOutput which is a child of the
                              application root
 -p,--prefixNotNecessary      Do not apply a system prefix.  Use this if
                              you have persistent identifiersalready in
                              place-- that is, they are resolvable,
                              persistent, and especially you must ensure
                              they are all properly formatted URIs.  If
                              you do not add this option, the default is
                              to use a system specific prefix.
 -s,--sqlite                  output SQLite files only
 -t,--simplifierType <arg>    *Required {genbank|dwc}

==Examples==

Suppose we want to triplify a darwin core archive and write output to a specified directory.  We would use the following command:

{{{
./triplify myDarwinCoreArchive.zip -o /myHomeDir/output -t dwc

Beginning SQlite creation & connection
Fixing missing or empty "eventID" column.
Fixing missing or empty "locationID" column.
Fixing missing or empty "taxonID" column.
Fixing missing or empty "identificationID" column.
Removing unneeded columns from the main table.
Beginning simplifier instantiation
Beginning mapping file creation
Beginning triple file creation
Done! see, /myHomeDir/output/myDarwinCoreArchive.zip.triples.ttl
}}}

==Running from Source==
You may also choose to download the entire source tree, build using [http://ant.apache.org/ ant], and run using java itself from the commandline:
{{{
svn checkout http://triplifier.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ triplifier-read-only
cd triplifier-read-only/
mkdir dist
ant
java -classpath .:./out/triplifier:./lib/* triplify -h
java -classpath .:./out/triplifier/:./lib/* triplify myDarwinCoreArchive.zip -t dwc
