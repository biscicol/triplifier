The semantic web relies on valid URIs to be able to traverse relationships between objects.  This document describes how to deal with this in the context of the Triplifier, specifically when entering values in the "ID Prefix" field.

== URIs ==

Valid URIs contain a URI scheme name  (such as "http", "ftp", "urn", or "file") followed by a colon and then any identifying content.  Without the URI scheme, the identifier is not a valid URI and the content associated with this identifier will not be linkable to other content in the semantic web.  

Most databases do not currently use valid URIs as identifiers, but we encourage people to create them so data can be discoverable and linkable via both human and machine interfaces.  Several excellent resources are:

== If your data is already structured to use URIs ==

If your identifiers are already valid URIs (e.g. urn:1234 or http://biocode.berkeley.edu/events/856) then leave the text box blank.

== Converting Literals to URIs ==

If your identifers are not valid URIs (as is the case with most database identifiers) then you can easily convert them into valid URIs in the triplifier by assigning a prefix to identifiers for each entity in the Entities section of the triplifier.   For, example, if you have an identifier that is "856" then you can make it globally unique and resolvable by entering a prefix, such as "http://biocode.berkeley.edu/events/", which will then result in a valid URI of http://biocode.berkeley.edu/events/856.
