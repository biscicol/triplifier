= What can I do with my RDF-formatted data? =

Once you convert your data to RDF triples, you can use them in many different ways.  To start with, though, you might want to experiment with visualizing or querying your data.

If you want to visualize your data, and you have fewer than 20 records, you can use simple graph visualization tools.  A good online tool is the [http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/ W3C RDF validator].  To use the RDF Validator, you will first need to convert your N-Triples or Turtle output to RDF/XML format using the [http://www.rdfabout.com/demo/validator/  RDF Validator and Convertor].  Another tool that you can use is the software package [http://graphviz.org/ GraphViz].  Select "DOT (GraphViz)" when triplifying your data.  You can also choose to [http://datamining.cs.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/dot2vue.cgi convert] your DOT graphviz file to the [http://vue.tufts.edu/ VUE (Visual Understanding Environment)] format which offers more functionality in manipulating the output.  

If you have more than 20 records, you can use  [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/ SPARQL].  To use SPARQL, you will want to create a local "triplestore" where you can load all of your triplified data and run SPARQL queries.  Popular triplestores for RDF data are [http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/ Virtuoso], [http://franz.com/agraph/allegrograph/ AllegroGraph], [http://www.openrdf.org/ OpenRDF Sesame], or Jena's [http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/ Fuseki].  All of these datastores include SPARQL support, and they can also run queries that incorporate other semantic data stores such as [http://dbpedia.org/â€Ž DBpedia].
